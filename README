This library contains various tools for working with CC2500 wireless transceivers:
- Configuration parsing/modification
- Parsing packets as seen on the air (after demodulation)
- Live parsing of packets from an RTL-SDR device
- Simple rx/tx over an SPI bridge

I have minimal experience at best of working with RF; for example, the packet
detection code in parse_stream() has no provisions for keeping synchronized with
the packets beyond the initial bit/byte synchronization. (ie. the preamble and
sync words) As such, any contributions to the RF-facing parts of this library by
anyone knowledgeable about those things are especially welcome.
